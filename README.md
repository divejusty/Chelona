# Chelona
Chelona is a collection of classes that can be used as a basis for a lightweight framework. Please note that the idea behind it is to learn and not for serious use. As a side effect of this, functionalities may be broken or missing entirely. Implementation quality can also vary significantly.

Since this is a project with an educational purpose, feedback is more than welcome!
